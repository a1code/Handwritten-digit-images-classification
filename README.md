# Handwritten-digit-images-classification

Dataset : [THE MNIST DATABASE of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

- Implemented kNN algorithm, with a Flask app, for classifying the handwritten digit images, that are uploaded from the UI.

- Wrote modules in Numpy, for forward/back prop, random/He initialization, mini-batch GD/Momentum/Adam optimizers, L2 regularization, dropout, and softmax output layer, to setup a neural network for the multinomial image classification task. When trained using Adam optimizer with dropout, the model obtained training accuracy of x% and validation accuracy of y%.

- Developed a CNN model using Tensorflow for the classification task. The model achieved prediction accuracies of x% and y% on the training and validation sets respectively.
